 Hi. I’m Olivia, a software developer from Brazil. My major knowledge is on Python, C++, Java and SQL.
 
 Everything about technology has my focused interest. To learn anything new about software development, AI, ML and data realms.

 I see coding as an instrument to solve problems and create solutions for everyday life.
 
 Looking forward to collaborate on backend and data analysis projects.
