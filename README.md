 Hi. I’m Olivia, a software developer from Brazil. My major knowledge is on Python, C++, JavaScript, Java and databases.
 
 Everything about technology has my focused interest. To learn anything new about the web development, AI, ML and big data realms.
 
 I’m currently amplifying my skills on full stack development. 

 I see coding as an instrument to solve problems and create solutions for everyday life.
 
 I look forward to collaborate on web development projects and data analysis projects.
