 Hi. I’m Olivia, a software developer from Brazil. My major knowledge is on Python, C++, Java and Javascript.
 
 Everything about technology has my focused interest, and, more specifically, software development. I am a full stack developer with a focus on back-end development.

 I see coding as an instrument to solve problems and create solutions for everyday life.
 
 Looking forward to collaborate on backend projects.
